        <p>I have chosen the CSS options for more practice on the various different CSS possibilities.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Linear Gradients- I used a gray gradient background on my body and a green gradient on my container div.
            </li>
            <li>Multi-column Layouts- The layout starts as one vertical layout on mobile, then at the 768px breakpoint
                turns into a 2 column
                layout, then at the 1100px breakpoint turns into a 3 column layout.</li>
            <li>Box Shadow- I added a box shadow on my container div article block to give it a cool sort of 3d look,
                and a strong
                contrast to the background.</li>

            <li>Alpha Transparency- For my container div, I changed the background to a dark green with an Alpha
                Transparency of 30% </li>
            <li>Use a media-query to swap in a high-resolution image(s) on a high-res device- For the smaller screen
                viewport up to the 1100px breakout, I have 2 images. Then at the 1100px breakout the images swap out
                into 2 different ones.</li>
            <li>CSS structural pseudo-classes- For the pseudo class, I put an Nth child on my container div, with the
                purpose of changing the color of
                just one of my captions (this is some cool stuff! into red). </li>
        </ul>
